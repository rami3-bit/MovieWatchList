# MovieWatchList
A small web app to search movies via OMDB, show poster, rating, runtime, and plot, and let users add/remove titles in a local watchlist (localStorage). It includes poster fallbacks, duplicate protection, and toast notifications for actions.

## Features
- Movie search with full details (poster fallback, rating, runtime, plot).
- Add/remove to personal watchlist (stored in localStorage).
- Duplicate check + user feedback via toast.
- Responsive layout with improved film card design.

## Notes
- I explored using AI assistance for parts of the UI/design iteration in this project.
- Replace the OMDB API key with your own if needed.

## Getting Started
Open `index.html` in a browser (or use a simple static server). Ensure network access to OMDB API.
